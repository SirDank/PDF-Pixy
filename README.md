# ðŸ’ InformationðŸ’ 

- The website is built using python and flask.
- The website uses a simple file sharing system with token based authentication ( for downloads ) and password hashing ( for storing passwords ).

- A user remains authenticated for a maximum of one day.
- Users can share pdf files owned by them to other registered users.
